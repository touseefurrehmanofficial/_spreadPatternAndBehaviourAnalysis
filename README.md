# Spread Pattern and Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes spread patterns and behaviors using data-driven techniques and models. It aims to identify underlying patterns in data and apply analytical methods for better insights into behaviors associated with these patterns. The project may involve statistical analysis, machine learning algorithms, and visual representations to interpret the data.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Automated data collection from relevant sources for spread pattern analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Application of statistical models to understand the distribution and spread of data.
- **Behavioral Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning models to predict or categorize behaviors based on patterns.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of data for better interpretation of trends and patterns.
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for running, visualizing, and analyzing spread patterns with ease.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Scikit-learn
  - Seaborn (optional)
